# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

Axios - To make HTTP requests between the frontend / backend.

React Icons - To use some SVG icons on the application.

React Router DOM - To make the routes of the application and navigate from one page to another more easily.

React Spinners - To make the effect of loading in the application when u search for some user or just open the Home page.

React Toastify - To give the user a notification if everything occurred correctly or an error happened based on the status 
of requests or actions.



# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Try a new layout maybe or something like that.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
The layout and the way that the users are displayed with the pagination using the loading effect too.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
In the search function because i have to learn how the json-server work with this.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
It was a cool test, I had never used json-server before, it served me as a great learning experience. But as a suggestion 
I would give a test using some public API like Github or any other.
